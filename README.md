TUMmetrics evaluates blogging websites across key performance criteria, assigns a score out of 100, and provides AI-powered recommendations for improvement.
It allows creators to quickly understand where their site is strong and where it needs improvement, helping them optimize their websites for readers and search engines alike.

How It Works
TUMmetrics evaluates websites based on eight main criteria:

1. *SEO Title Optimization*  Are titles the right length for search engines?
2. *Image Accessibility*  Are images missing Alt tags?
3. *Content Depth*  Does the article meet a minimum word count?
4. *UX Readability*  Are paragraphs readable and not too long?
5. *Link Visibility*  Are internal and external links properly structured?
6. *Website Layout (Mobile)*  Is the site mobile-friendly?
7. *Search Time (UX)*  How long until the user finds what it needs?
8. *Annoyance Level (Ads)*  Do ads interfere with user experience?
